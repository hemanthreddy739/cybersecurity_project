ctrl+c ==> used to terminate the program completely
ctrl+z ==> it seems to stop the program but it just pauses the program and puts it in the background.

==> every program is assigned with an id in linux.

==> to see all the background programs 
     # jobs

==> to bring a program from background to foreground.
==> # fg program_id.

===> some special thing.
# program_name &
 --> putting an '&' at the end of the command can makes,the program went to background+running,and also gives command_prompt enabling user to execute another commands.
--> but on executing command without any (&) at the end ,and then on pressing ctrl+z then the program pauses and then moved to background.

==> # echo "`date`"  --> prints the date command.
==> echo -n "hello"  --> removes new line.
==> echo -e "hello\nbye" --> then only escape character works ==> hello
								  bye

==>
[root@localhost Desktop]# echo -e "hello\b babu"
hell babu
[root@localhost Desktop]# echo -e "hello\b"
hello
[root@localhost Desktop]# echo -ne "hello\b"
hell[root@localhost Desktop]# 



---------------------

==> to find all the running process we use
    $ ps -aux | grep specific_process_name.

==> every process is associated with an process id
    --> find the process id which you want to terminate than
         $ kill process_id

===> to open a terminal from a terminal using a command 
     $ gnome-terminal

------------------------------------

--> to verify a user is exists or not
       $ cat /etc/passwd
       $ id username
--> to add new user $ useradd username
--> to get more details of user 
      the below files contains much information about users
       --> cat /etc/passwd
       --> cat /etc/shadow  ==> gives whether the user had a password or not -->if had a password it is hashed.
       --> cat /etc/gshadow.

==> to change password for a user 
    $ passwd user_name




=> on importing os module of python you can run the commands of the linux,windows through the system()

       import os
       os.system("date")
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL ABOUT SHELL:-
================
--> without the process we can't do any thing in the OS.
--> somebody is there to read the command u typed in the terminal and find where that 
     command located in the filesystem and executes(run) for the user.
--> that somebody is a program <==>SHELL
--> the command prompt is also known as shell prompt
	--> behind the scene of execution of date command.
		$which date
                  $/usr/bin/date
--> SHELL IS  a concept name and there are many flavors of shell are available 
             -->csh,zsh,pksh,fish, popular --> bash shell.

--> for getting the shell you have to login

==> ways to interact with os 
    -gui,cli(that to shell is involved in interacting with os),webui,mobile app.

==> gui EXAMPLES :-gnome,kde

--> to set the foreground colour of the shell 
      $ tput setaf 0to7   --> setaf = set attribute for foreground
    forbackground 
      $ tput setab 0to7  
        to see its effect on whole screen 
          $ clear


======================================

===========

--> repl --> read evaluate print loop.
--> the sites like replit,aws,etc user docker technology to install,boot,and launch an 
    new operating system innjust 5-10 sec.
    --> also by using of the docker technology the consumption of memory is also very minimum.


--> to print the escape characters also 
       print(r"hello\nlearners")  -->o/p --> hello\nlearners.
---> the technical term which means replacing of the escape characters with their duty is called
      INTERPOLATION.



==> ANY USER IN ANY OS ONLY USE THE 2 THINGS --> WITH FILE AND FOLDER.


--> RPM:- redhat package management

--> to query that a specific s/w is installed or not 
 
$ rpm -q firefox
$ rpm -q -a    ==> gives the list of all commands that are installed in the computer.

==> software is a collection of modules ,collection af several software gives an OS.

==> to find from which s/w the command is came :)

lets say date command

$ which date ==> it gives some path where the command date is located
$ rpm -q -f that_path  ==> gives the s/w file name.


--> software = package = setupfile = rpm
--> mostly the s/w extensions for the windows ==> .exe, .msi   | and for redhat_linux  ==>.rpm

==> installing any s/w is nothing but copying the files into our hard-drive 
==> uninstalling is nothing but removing all the files and folders from hdd which was created by  the s/w.

===> command to uninstall s/w
$ rpm -e s/w_name     --> 'e'  is erase.

 
==> you can install the any missed or uninstalled basic s/w from the redhatlinux.
--> it can be reinstalled in 3 ways 
    1)  go into the internet and download the s/w and install.
    2)  using yum command through terminal   
    3)  by attaching the iso-file(red hat feels it is an dvd) then
         on selecting file_folder
                          >iso-file(dvd)
                             >appsream or >baseos
-->then right click on the white-space and select open with terminal then u straight away changed into that path .

$ rpm -i s/w_name    --> 'i' --> for installing , 'v' --> verbose<==> gives background going details, 'h' --> hash <==> it shows the progress in percentage.

----------------------------------------------------------

==> if you can read the ram you can do hacking:)

==> when you login into any account(like fb) after checking your login credentials the fb will
    send you a "token"<==>cookie it is very important and it is stored in browser.

 
==> to get where the command is located i.e in which file 
   $ which command_name

==> what ever you do in the firefox it will be stored in the below folder its location
        ==> $HOME/.mozilla
              >then go into firefox
                    >then you will find a folder named with some name and with an (.default) extension, move into it.
                        > then you will find "cookies.sqlite" --> there you find your token given 
                                        by FB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### if there is a problem during the creation of the user it is due to created of the 
      file calles "/etc/passwd.lock" it should be removed.

	$ rm /etc/passwd.lock

## $ rpm -q -i s/w_name    ==> gives some more information about the s/w.


#### linux is opensource ,but not all s/w source code is available in our linux os,because it is a burden .
 	## but the source is availabe at some website to find the website the procedure.

              FOR EXAMPLE TO FIND THE SOURCE CODE OF THE DATE:-
		$ which date    ---> gives the file location which had date command.
                $ rpm -q -f (o/p_given by which date)    --> gives through which s/w the is came into 
			the os.
		--> then u have to find more information of the s/w
		$ rpm -q -i (s/w_name_that _u finded_out)
                            --> in the info u find "source rpm"   ==> that place had the source code of that s/w.
	


==> when ever u installed any s/w in linux lots of file are created in miltiple locations.


==> $ eog file_name.jpg/png  --> eog command is used to open the image files.
